# Soul Vitric

A small mod that adds Soul Vitric and Charred Soul Vitric, soul sand alternatives to glass and tinted glass respectively.

This mod was made from Modfest: Singularity's theme of 'one feature'.
We did not actually enter the modfest for personal reasons, but felt like making a mod using the theme anyway.
