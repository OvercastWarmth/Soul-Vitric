# Soul Vitric

A small mod that adds Soul Vitric and Charred Soul Vitric, soul sand alternatives to glass and tinted glass respectively.
- They are made from smelting soul sand in a furnance for vitric, and a blast furnance for charred vitric.
- Charred vitric acts like tinted glass, blocking out light, and normal vitric can be turned into panes.
- All vitric has the same blast resistence as cobblestone (making it immune to ghast fireballs), and can be picked up without silk touch.
